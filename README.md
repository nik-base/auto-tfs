## Prerequisites
This extension operates with TF API provided by Microsoft. So, you need either
1. Have Visual Studio IDE installed with TFS capabilities (i.e. TF.exe installed).  
or
2. TeamExplorerEverywhere installed (https://github.com/Microsoft/team-explorer-everywhere)
> **Note:** Possibly, some other 3rd party tools would also work, if they provide the same output and receives the same commands / args

> **Note (for TeamExplorerEverywhere):** Possibly, works under Linux-based systems and MacOS, but I have no ability to test it

## Additional Prerequisites
- Extension would only work for a workspace already mapped on TFS (Preferably mapped as Server workspace).  
- Visual Studio Code - Minimum version requried for extension is 1.58.2.  

## Installation

1. Open up VS Code
2. Type **`F1`**
3. Type `ext` in command palette.
4. Select `Extensions: Install Extension` and hit **`ENTER`**
5. Type `auto-tfs`
6. Select **`Auto TFS`** extension and hit **`ENTER`**

## Configuration

A full path to TF tool should be specified in Settings (**File > Preferences > Settings**). (Recommended to configure in Workspace settings)  
The following entry is needed:

```
    "auto-tfs.tf.path": "<path-to-tf-command-line>"
```

If you are going to use the `tf.exe` tool embedded into Visual Studio IDE, the value to specify will be similar to -  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\TF.exe`  

Recent versions of Visual Studio has changed this path, here is a sample of Visual Studio 2019 (Professional) -  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer\TF.exe`  

For TEE, it will be like this: `C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamExplorerEverywhere\tf.cmd`  

Another supported setting serves for logging information into Output. To enable this, just add following option to VS Code Settings:
```
    "auto-tfs.tf.debug": true
```

## Usage
1. Invoke the command bar (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Start typing some of the command listed below or just Auto TFS. The full names of commands:
```
Auto TFS: Checkout
Auto TFS: Undo
Auto TFS: Add
Auto TFS: Delete
Auto TFS: Here (Compare)
Auto TFS: In Visual Studio (Compare)
Auto TFS: Get Latest
Auto TFS: Get All Latest
Auto TFS: Sync
Auto TFS: Open on server
```

Additionally, for ease of use you can configure the extension to support below functionalities â€“
- Compare file with latest server version either in Visual Studio code itself or in Visual Studio.
- Sync workspace to get color coded changes with bades (for modified, renamed, deleted, added, renamed & modified) as you get it Git
- View changes in source control with badges
- Open file on server (browser).
- Compare, View, Revert, Open on server directly from Source Control Manager.
- Get Changes Count on SCM View
- Revert All / Get All on SCM
- Status with Get All and Sync buttons
- Editor title icons for Compare (in code it self), get latest and open on server.
- Get latest of one or more files or folders (Recursive) or entire workspace.
- Configurable Automatic operations.
- Configurable confirmation of automatic operations.
- Auto Checkout on Save
- Auto Checkout on Change
- Auto Add to source control on Add
- Auto Delete from source control on Delete
- Auto Rename on source control on Rename (Known issue - works but throws exception)
- Add, Checkout and Undo operation can be performed via context menu in Explorer (multiple), Editor and Editor Tile.

## Features

* Authorization process, if needed. This is performed by command bar. In case of the necessivity, you will be prompted to enter the credentials from your TFS account, where the current file is mapped to. Otherwise, a command will be executed silently.

* Checkout
* Undo
* Delete
* Get Latest
* Get All Latest
* Sync
* Open on server
